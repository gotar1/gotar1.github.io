      Hello, My name is Eltahir Gotar. Am a graduate of Penn State University class of 2010 majoring in chemical engineering. Currently am taking a data science bootcamp which will be done by end of December. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite a learning experience doning this bootcamp. At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue or not however, now am glad am still going and am loving every piece of it. Data science and statistic is very challenging and very fun at the same time. I LOVE IT.
